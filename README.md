# 42-core-projects NEW 42 VERSION 2025

* Those are my projects in 42 core.
* Separated into numbered modules.
* Each module it's projects.

>[!note] open the Notes dir from Obsidian --> This is what I use to make my notes.

* I have two directories at my 42 device on-site, one for sharing github between my personal device (laptop) and my device in the lab. The other directory just for my in-physical projects inside the lab.
* If I am working from home, I would edit the first directory and when finish I will upload it on my github repo.
	* On my device at 42, I will pull it use `git pull` then use `rsync`, to sync the files on my main local working directory.
* If I am working inside 42, I will make `rsync` to my shared directory (the one I can upload on github), then push it on my github repo account.
